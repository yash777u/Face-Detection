# Face-Detection

## Webcam Face Detection using OpenCV

### Overview:
This Python script demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCV with a webcam. It detects faces in the video stream and draws rectangles around them.

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)

### Instructions:
1. Install Python 3.x if not already installed.
2. Install OpenCV by running: `pip install opencv-python`
3. Run the script.
4. A window will open showing the webcam feed with detected faces highlighted by rectangles.
5. Press 'Esc' key to close the window and stop the script.

### Files:
- `webcam_face_detection.py`: Python script for face detection.
- `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`: Pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for face detection.

### Usage:
- Use the script for real-time face detection in a webcam feed.
- Adjust parameters in the script as needed for optimal face detection performance.
